When asked, click "continue" and wait until all tools are installed. 

There are two terminals (menu on the right), one to install things "install mamba: bash" and one to work in "activate mamba: gp". At the beginning, the first terminal will be busy installing things and downloading the course material. This will take a minute. 

Once all tools are installed and data downloaded, the terminal "activate mamba: gp" will become active and you can start working.
