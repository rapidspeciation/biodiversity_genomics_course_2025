When asked, click "continue" and wait until all tools are installed. 

There are two terminals (menu on the right), one to install things "install mamba" and one to work in "activate mamba". At the beginning, the first terminal will be busy installing things and downloading the course material. This will take a minute. 

Once all tools are installed and data downloaded, the terminal "activate mamba" will become active and you can start working.
